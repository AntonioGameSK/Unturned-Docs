# Server Hosting Rules

Servers that violate these rules may be temporarily or permanently banned.

## Monetization

Starting on May 28th warnings will begin getting sent out for breaking this rule, and it will take full effect on June 11th.

Hosts are allowed to sell permanent benefits and monthly subscriptions. Consumable microtransactions are **not** allowed.

Examples of allowed monetization:
- Accepting donations.
- Selling permanent or monthly subscription access to play on the server(s).
- Selling ranks, kits, unlocks, benefits, etc. available permanently or for the duration of the monthly subscription. Timers or cooldowns are fine.
- Selling cosmetics like custom skins, name tags, chat colors, etc. available permanently or for the duration of the monthly subscription.
- Selling services or commissions, for example a modder taking commissions for new content that gets added to the server for all players.

Examples of banned monetization:
- Selling in-game items like weapons, ammunition, supplies, bases, etc.
- Selling in-game vehicles.
- Selling experience points.
- Selling currency.
- Selling ranks, kits, unlocks, benefits, etc. which stack with themselves as a loophole.
