## Monetization Types

**October 16, 2022 clarification:** Selling *vanilla* cosmetics, such as those available from the Stockpile or Steam Community Market, is not allowed. When offering cosmetics as a server microtransaction, the server network should should own (or have licensed) the rights to that content. Servers should not sell cosmetic content that they do not own the right to, such as vanilla cosmetics (either official, or community-contributed).

**August 2, 2021 update:** Fictitious and deceptive pricing is not allowed. For example, lying that a discount is nearly expired, or pretending the price is discounted when it has never been at full price. We would strongly advise following [Steam's discounting rules](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/discounts) to help avoid breaking any real-world laws.

Warnings for breaking the monetization rules first began being sent out on May 28, 2021. The monetization rules have now been in full effect since June 11, 2021.

Hosts are allowed to sell permanent benefits and monthly subscriptions. Consumable microtransactions are **not** allowed.

Examples of allowed monetization:
- Accepting donations.
- Selling permanent or monthly subscription access to play on the server(s).
- Selling ranks, kits, unlocks, benefits, etc. available permanently or for the duration of the monthly subscription. Timers or cooldowns are fine.
- Selling **custom** cosmetics like custom skins, name tags, chat colors, etc. available permanently or for the duration of the monthly subscription.
- Selling services or commissions, for example a modder taking commissions for new content that gets added to the server for all players.

Examples of banned monetization:
- Selling in-game items like weapons, ammunition, supplies, bases, etc.
- Selling in-game vehicles.
- Selling experience points.
- Selling currency.
- Selling ranks, kits, unlocks, benefits, etc. which stack with themselves as a loophole.
- Selling copies of **vanilla** cosmetics, such as those available on the Stockpile or Steam Community Market.

## Monetization Filter

The "Monetization" field in each server's Config.json file defaults to "Unspecified", but can be set to "None" or "NonGameplay". If configuring this field please ensure to be truthful. "None" is for unmonetized or donation-only servers, and "NonGameplay" is for servers with purchases that do not provide a gameplay advantage. Players filtering the server list by "NonGameplay" will also see "None" servers.
