Unturned Documentation
======================

These are the source files for *Unturned*'s modding documentation.

The built documentation is hosted by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) here: https://docs.smartlydressedgames.com/

Building the Docs
-----------------

The documentation is written in [reStructuredText](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/) and parsed/built using [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx).

With Python and Sphinx installed run `make html` in the root folder to create the site locally at `/_build/html/index.html`.

Editing using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [reStructuredText Extension](https://docs.restructuredtext.net/) is recommended.
