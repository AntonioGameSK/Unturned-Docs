# Gun Assets

Noting these here for now until gun properties are documented:

**Damage_Falloff_Range** *float*: percentage of maximum range where damage begins decreasing according to multiplier. Defaults to 1. For example a value of 0.3 with a range of 200 means damage begins dropping off after 60 meters.

**Damage_Falloff_Multiplier** *float*: percentage of damage to apply at maximum range. Defaults to 1. For example a value of 0.25 with a damage of 40 means 10 damage will be dealt at maximum range.
